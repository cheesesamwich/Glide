## 3AM 🌙

Just a quick heads-up: I'm currently working on the 3AM Plugin, introducing features like custom fonts, server animations, and a privacy blur—all configurable within the Discord app. Development will be relatively quiet, but there's some cool stuff in the pipeline.

When the 3AM Plugin is ready, the original 3AM theme will step aside. Unfortunately, support for other modded Discord clients won't be available anymore. The transition will be from detailed code comments to a simpler, user-friendly setup within the plugin.

If you want to spy on my shenanigans, I'm pretty active in the Vencord server's CSS development channel.

Anyway, here's a sneak peek (will be updated over time):

### Planned Or Potential Features

#### Ideas
- Moving 3AM to a plugin for better support and customization
- Making small adjustments to Spotify Listen Along invites for a cleaner look
- Improving selectors for more reliable updates

#### Bugs
- Adding comments to some class recolor lines
- Adjusting online status indicators that appear stretched (seemingly fixed, maybe?? I'm not sure, lol)
- Fixing the color of the Soundmoji experiment search button
- Maxwell's loading screen still sometimes shows keybind indicators

### Instructions

#### Vencord Installation

To get 3AM vibes on your Vencord:

1. Go to settings.
2. Navigate to the themes section.
3. Click on online themes.
4. Paste this URL: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cheesesamwich/3AM/main/3AM.css`

#### Other Client Installation

Currently, there's no documented support for other modded Discord clients. It's tested on Vencord but might work elsewhere.
